# iOS DEVLOPMENT STARTERS :computer:

*Hi, I am going to document all my learnings for **iOS development** :iphone: in this repository, this is to help new iOS developers who want to start there career in this field and also for my future refernce*

***NOTE :- Please help me out to build a great repository for iOS app development by sharing your learnings, adding some important tips and tricks or topics which I missed. Not including any resource links except official apple's developer site. :star_struck:***

## Where to start (iOS Development Roadmap) :world_map:

The legacy roadmap for all the aspiring iOS app developer :

![ios Development Roadmap](https://i.redd.it/ix44k24k9ik01.png)

This is too much to learn and graps, so I have picked up essential things to start with.

## Basics

##### LEARN SWIFT
  * The first thing to do is learn **SWIFT** language. 
  * Big legacy organizations are using *Objective-C*, but swift will be enough to get you a good start in iOS app development as currently many companies are using Swift for the development.

##### PLAYAROUND XCODE
  * While you are learning swift you need to have an IDE which support swift programming.
  * XCODE's playground will be enough to learn swift language and get a hang of the IDE.
  * Later when you start developing apps you should learn more about XCODE and its functionalities. Which could help you in long run.
  
##### LEARN THE FRAMEWORKS
  * While there are two major framework to develop an iOS APP, which are *UIKIT* and *SWIFTUI*.
  * I would personally suggest to learn *UIKIT*, as it is a legacy framework which came way before *SWIFTUI* and have much more functionality than the later.
  * Later switching over to *SWIFTUI* will be easy. But one have to go with the emerging technology to be in the field, so learn SWIFTUI when you are comfortable with UIKIT basics.
  * Now SWIFTUI has the capability to create an app ready for deployment, but with the integration of UIKIT the app can be more powerful.
  * SWIFTUI is growing to become a powerful framework for app development, but it will take time.

## Common Topics

##### MOBILE HUMAN INTERFACE GUIDELINE
  * Apple emphasise on human interface and UI designs for an iOS APP.
  * I would suggest when ever you are developing something, please refer to the Apple's developer Human Interface Guidlines
    > https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/
    
##### iOS TECHNOLOGIES
  * This section is all about human interaction and what is app life cycle.
  * App architecture.
  * App life-cycle.
  * Auto layout (for different mobile screen size).
  * What should happen when a tap gesture is done or other iPhone supported gesture (even handling).
  
##### DESIGN PATTERN
  * This is where you decide which design pattern your app folder architecture should follow.
  * For a developer an app's architecture design defines a lot about the project.
  * There are many design pattern, like MVC (MODAL VIEW CONTROLLER), MVP (MODAL VIEW PRESENTER), MVVM (MODAL VIEW VIEWMODAL).
  * I would suggest to learn about all the above mentioned, but focus more on MVVM as it is much more efficient as compared to other design patterns.
  
##### NETWORK PROGRAMMING
  * One of the most important topic for you app development.
  * How can you fetch data and upload data using network.
  * My suggestion would be learning about RESTful API.
  * You should know how to get a JSON data for you app. 
  
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

## GETTING DEEPER
*After you have come this far now its Time to really start the development related work*

##### ADDITIONAL TOPICS
  * Protocol oriented programming
  * Concurrent programming
    - DispatchQueue
    - Actors
  * Advance design patterns (not important right now, you can pick this up later in your career)
    - VIPER
    
##### PACKAGE MANAGER
  * There are three major package manager for developer to choose frome
    - Swift Package Manager
    - CocoaPods
    - Carthage
  * All three are good, but my personal suggestion is CARTHAGE.
  * Carthage help developers to download and manage all dependencies without any clutter in there project folder.
  * CoccoaPods creates its own .xcworkspace for all the dependencies in your project. Which can confuse a developer.
  
##### INSTRUMENTS
  * Xcode provides developers with tools which makes his/her life easier.
  * This tools helps developers to check for memory leaks, activity management etc.
  
##### TESTING
  * One of the most important thing to learn is unit testing.
  * Swift has its own framework for it, that is **XCTest**.
  * UI testing
  * Code coverage

##### DEBUGGING
  * Debugging can help solve most of the errors and also check out other developers codes.
  * It can be done using
    - Breakpoints
    - LLDB (TOOL)
    - Visual Debugging
  
****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

## START BUILDING AND DEPLOYMENT

##### BUILD & DEPLOYMENT
  * There are many tools which helps a developer to follow CI (continuous integration) like:
    - Jenkins
    - Travis
    - Fastlane
    - XCodeServer
  * The most widely used and efficient one is **FASTLANE**.
  
##### ANALYTIC TOOLS
  * Tools which helps helps to monitor an app performance and take review from beta testers for you app.
    - Google Analytics
    - Fabric
    - TestFlight
    - UserHabit
  * My personal recommendation would be **TestFlight**.
  
##### APP STORE
  * After all these hardships, there still remains the final test for you to prove your App.
  * You should have a iTunes connect account.
  * To pass that **REVIEW PHASE**, one should follow the apple's developer review guidlines.
    > https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/
  * Last you should be lucky to have a good reviewer.

 ## AUTHOR'S NOTE
   > ***I am also new to iOS Development, so helping myself by documenting my learnings to help others :smile:***
   
   * I am not an expert, so I did not attached any resources except official site links.
   * So please help me by sharing resources to learn all the above, for others.
   * It would be highly greatful, if you provide improvemeents by raising a PR.
   * This repository will constantly grow according to my learning and knowledge.
